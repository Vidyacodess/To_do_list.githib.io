Introducing my To-Do List App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app is designed to help users stay organized and manage tasks effectively.

🔍 What I learned:

🛠️ JavaScript DOM manipulation for creating dynamic functionality.

🎨 Designing a responsive UI using CSS to ensure a seamless experience on any device.

💾 Leveraging localStorage to save tasks even after a page refresh.

🌙 Adding a Dark Mode toggle for a personalized user experience.

🎯 Enhancing my understanding of task management with features like priority levels, due dates, and task categories.
I’m excited about the skills I’ve gained from this project, and I’m looking forward to more challenges in the coming weeks!
